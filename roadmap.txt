I probably won't update the repo much in the next 3 months since my intern
started.  

I will try to keep on reading Crafting Interpreters a bit and keep
on working on COMOL's design


book reading : 

19.3

COMOL design : 

    pretty vague atm not gonna lie ; 
    

COMOL implementation :

     I will implement a version of Clox first n then keep the backend of the interpreter and redo 
     the front-end for COMOL


might be an issue w linecounter
need to make the functions fit the implementation of the line counter n such 
might change the scanner / parser from custom implem to generate with bison I'm not sure yet

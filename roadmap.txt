book reading : 

reading through 17.5

COMOL design : 

    pretty vague atm not gonna lie ; 
    

COMOL implementation :

     I will implement a version of Clox first n then keep the backend of the interpreter and redo 
     the front-end for COMOL




will have to get the globals outta here cuz they annoy me ; will do that after I'm done w chap 17

need to make the functions fit the implementation of the line counter n such 
might change the scanner / parser from custom implem to generate with bison I'm not sure yet

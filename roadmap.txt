book reading : 

finished chapter 14; 
gonna do the challenges


COMOL design : 

    pretty vague atm not gonna lie 

COMOL implementation :

    not really started tbh

write getLine()

test getLine()

put lines in their own file; 

I just thought and the array of Lines doesn't have to be dynamic bc the number of lines is NOT 
something that will change 
I just need to initialise it at start n then keep it updated


maybe i should store capa in 0 n 1 index the bitch cuz lines start at fucking 1

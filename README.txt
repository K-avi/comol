At the moment, I use this repository to document my reading of 
the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom ( https://craftinginterpreters.com )
I will also document my ideas for the design of COMOL here. 
I'll make the repo clean at some point.

When I'm done reading it I will repurpose the C interpreter for Lox to interpret my own 
language COMOL

COMOL will reuse a lot of the code and concepts described in this book so please check it out. 

I'm making COMOL for fun and to learn more about how to make high level languages. 

COMOL stands for COmmon Music Oriented Language.
It's name is obviously a pun on the COBOL name but it doesn't share any similarities to it.

COMOL is a high level script language designed to make solving Music Theory related problems easy. 
It will come with custom types representing different abstract musical objects 
(such as scales, dodecaphonic series, 12-tone rows, pitch class sets and so on ).

The goal of it is to make operations with these objects as easy as possible. 

COMOL will also support basic types such as integer, floats, lists, and maybe more advanced ones such
as maps. 

I'm designing COMOL while reading the book so I'm not sure to how it will look at the moment. 
I also don't really know if I should write COMOL while reading the book or just follow it and come back later and so on


PS: COMOL will be very different from the Lox language, at least in the types it support

This is the repository for the COMOL lanuage and it's interpreter.
I'm making it while reading the second part of the Crafting Interpreters book by Robert Nystrom ( https://craftinginterpreters.com )
COMOL will reuse a lot of the code described in this book so please check it out. 

I'm making COMOL for fun and to learn more about how to make high level languages. 

COMOL stands for COmmon Music Oriented Language.
It's name is obviously a pun on the COBOL name but it doesn't share any similarities to it.

COMOL is a high level script language designed to make solving Music Theory related problems easy. 
It will come with custom types representing different abstract musical objects 
(such as scales, dodecaphonic series, 12-tone rows, pitch class sets and so on ).

The goal of it is to make operations with these objects as easy as possible. 

COMOL will also support basic types such as integer, floats, lists, and maybe more advanced ones such
as maps. 

I'm designing COMOL while reading the book so I'm not sure to how it will look at the moment. 
I also don't really know if I should write COMOL while reading the book or just follow it and come back later and so on


PS: COMOL will be very different from the Lox language, at least in the types it support
